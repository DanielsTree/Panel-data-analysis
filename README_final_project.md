Panel-data-analysis
Ironhack Final project 12/2020. Socio-economic time-panel analysis in Python, based of self-constructed paneltable using different Regression models

Prework Excel:
1. I checked all corona related indicators on Eurostats: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/covid-19/data
 Which ones I could use. My first approach was using quarterly measured indicators. Decided which to choose and built up a time panel database. 
 But after discussing the strength a model could have with the few datapoints I had decided to build a new database.
2. Downloaded data tables as .tsv file and imported them to Excel.
3. Major prework/data manipulation for the time-panel analysis did in Excel, The imported tables looked like this when raw:
a) checked the data tables and values to get a feeling about the data
b) deleted columns freq, currency, bop_item, sector_10, sectorpart, stk_flow, partner
c) changed column name geo/time period to country.
d) cleaned the tables. deleted all letters and colons out of the numeric fields. Had to do this in different steps as datatype changed when simply replaced.
4. When data was clean to work with, I had a look on the time series, and countries I could use for Analysis. As seen in graphic above in some table some 
countries had missing data, or no data at all.
The countries were randomly chosen by availability of data. Decided to go for 13 countries because 13th is my birthday. And I didn ÃÅt want to spend 
too much time on creating a time series panel table. For each of the 13 countries there exist 8 indicators and 129 data points for each indicator, 
leads to a total datapoints for modelbuilding in machine learning analysis of:
Total: 13.416
5. Next step was to transpose each table
6. After finishing transposing the tables I built a time-panel-master.xlsx, where I did import the data in. Next page is seen a section of final version 
time-panel-master.xlsx to be imported in Python to be analyzed by descriptive, inferential, and advanced analytical models.
